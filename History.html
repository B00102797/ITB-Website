<h3> The History Of ITB</h3>
<p>ITB opened in 1999 and the first building was A Block.</p>
<p>The cement wasn't even properly dried when the first people entered, and had to walk around it.</p>
<p> The first ITB Logo was a <i>disaster</i>.</p>
<img src="images/oldlogo.png" alt="ITB's Old Logo">
<p> The Red and Green colouration meant it was very difficult for people with visual difficulties to see.</p>
<p> Advertisements for ITB would run on the radio.</p>
<p> The plot of land ITB is currently on was meant to be for the shopping centre </p>
<p> The first ceremony was held in 2001, just two years after the college had opened.</p>
<p> The idea for TUD started in <i>2012</i> and the legislation was just passed this year, 2018.</p>
<p> CDM, my course, Creative Digital Media, was launched in 2009.</p>
