<h1>Institute Of Technology Blanchardstown</h1>
<p> I sent out a survey asking several lecturers what they thought ITB's greatest achievement(s) was. </p>
<p> Here are their responses:</p>
<div id="response">
<p><i>'I suppose creating a viable third level institution for Dublin 15. Hopefully allowing some people to participate in third level education who might not otherwise have been able to.
'</i></p>
<hr>
<p><i>'Becoming part of Technological University '</i></p>
<hr>
<p><i>'The support and learning opportunities we have created with our students. We've been privileged to be part of people's lives, highs and lows as they have grown and developed personally and professionally.'</i></p>
<hr>
<p><i>'Providing third level education for the greater Dublin 15 area. Being a flexible college that meets the needs of the students rather than the other way around'</i></p>
<hr>
<p><i>'Develop and attract students from the surrounding areas - become a place where students can bloom.
'</i></p>
<hr>
<p><i>'Making a difference to individuals'</i></p>
<hr>
<p><i>'Making its mark as a centre for excellence, and being awarded 'Institute of Technology of the Year' for 2018. It's managed to evolve as the demands of the local population and changing student demographics have changed, and continues to grow and offer research and higher degrees.'</i></p>
<hr>
<p><i>'Increase in participation rates in third level in Dublin West, Great Graduates who are shaping a new society post recession, the role ITB staff and students played in achieving TU Status'</i></p>
<hr>
<p><i>'Ongoing delivery of excellence in education to the wider Dublin 15 community at both undergraduate and postgraduate levels. '</i></p>
<hr>
<p><i>'Creation of a student community that is passionate about making an impact on the new landscape of work and technology. A landscape that ITB had been a beacon in both keeping pace with, and being a contributor towards in making new frontiers.'</i></p>
<hr>
<p><i>'Making an impact on Dublin 15, increasing the level of participation in third level in Dublin 15. New buildings and a state of the art campus. Excellent graduates working in top organisations in Ireland and around the world.'</i></p>
<hr>
<p><i>'To have hopefully made some difference in the lives of the students who have come here'</i></p>
<hr>
<p><i>'Increasing 3rd level participation in the Dublin West area - making it possible for students to come to 3rd level that wouldn't have been able to in the past.'</i></p>
